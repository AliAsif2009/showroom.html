    <h3><center>
        Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), founded on March 7, 1916 in Munich, Germany, began as an aircraft engine manufacturer during World War I before expanding into motorcycles in 1923 and automobiles in 1928. The iconic blue-and-white roundel, inspired by the Bavarian flag, became a symbol of engineering precision and performance. Over the decades, BMW has earned its reputation as “The Ultimate Driving Machine”, blending luxury, innovation, and driving pleasure in equal measure. From its legendary M Division performance cars to pioneering electric models like the BMW i Series, the brand has consistently set benchmarks in design, technology, and driving dynamics. Today, BMW stands as one of the world’s most prestigious automotive manufacturers, embodying passion, craftsmanship, and the thrill of the road.
